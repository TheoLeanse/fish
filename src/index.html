	<p>We began on the Sussex coast. Just behind the seawall on the east beach in the
		village of Selsey. Men have fished from here for over 300 years. It is a history
		and a tradition. From the early willow pots came the crabs and lobsters that
		fed fashionable 19th century London and regaled travellers on the grand 20th
		century ocean liners.</p>

	<p>Today a quarter of a century after we began, we combine this tradition with
		innovation. We are constantly working to improve a blend of sustainable
		selective fishing methods, by pots and longlines, with unique facilities of
		our own design and development for live and cooked shellfish and beautiful
		chilled fish.</p>
